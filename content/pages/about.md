Hi,

I'm Nandor Biro, Software Engineer at [Whereby](https://whereby.com). I live in Hajduszoboszlo, Hungary with my wife and work from home. 

I like trying out new technologies and I'm also trying to reach a higher level of understanding in the ones that I use frequently.
Since I believe that [Learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/learn-in-public-nyc) can make me a better developer I started this blog.
